                    <p class="para">
                        An electric vehicle runs on electricity rather than the engine which generates power by burning
                        fuels and gases. Electric vehicles are used in several industries such as automobile and
                        transportation, agriculture, and many more. Majorly these vehicles are used in the agricultural
                        industry for various purposes such as harvesting. Conventional vehicles were the major cause of
                        global warming and pollution posing a threat to the environment. Using conventional vehicles
                        also leads to the depletion of natural resources as they work on diesel and gasoline. Therefore,
                        electric vehicles are considered a substitute to overcome these issues. Electric vehicles are
                        quick, extremely silent, cost-effective, and trouble-free to operate. They have low running
                        costs as they have fewer moving parts for maintenance. Moreover, they are environment-friendly
                        as they do not operate on fossil fuels. A large number of manufacturers are focusing on the
                        production of electric vehicles to serve their customers in a better way. For instance,
                        automakers in India, such as TATA Motors have added electrified vehicles to their product
                        portfolio which is a major milestone in the global electric commercial vehicles market.

                        Electric vehicles are the greatest invention of all time. The market for electric commercial
                        vehicles is expanding due to growing consumer awareness among the population in terms of the
                        negative impacts on the environment caused by fossil-fuel-based vehicles. The demand for
                        fuel-efficient and high-performance vehicles is driving the growth of the global market.
                        Therefore, the market of electric commercial vehicles has immense potential and is anticipated
                        to grow in the forecast period.

                        The propulsion segment is divided into battery electric vehicles (BEV), Plug-in electric hybrid
                        vehicles (PHEV), and Fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV). The battery electric vehicles (BEV)
                        segment is expected to witness the highest CAGR in the forecast period. A battery electric
                        vehicle (BEV) is a battery-powered electric vehicle that uses chemical energy stored in
                        rechargeable battery packs. The Plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEV) segment is also expected
                        to account for a larger revenue due to its enhanced electricity storage capacity. Plug-in
                        electric hybrid vehicles (PHEV) vehicles can be operated on electricity or fuel. Fuel-cell
                        electric vehicles (FCEV) employ ‘fuel cell technology\' to generate electricity. The chemical
                        energy of the fuel is converted directly into electric energy to run the vehicle. This type of

                        market during the forecast period. Electric vans produce no carbon emissions leading to improved
                        air quality and a better atmosphere. Electric buses, on the other hand, use electric motors and
                        can store electricity in the battery packs. Electric pick-up trucks are also used in various end

                        the battery capacity. Each kW adds up to 4 miles of range per hour. The 50-250kWh battery
                        capacity will take up to 3 hours to charge its full capacity. The above 250kWh gives the best
                        battery performance and is expected to give the highest CAGR in the forecast period. This

                        majorly in last-mile delivery which means the final step of delivering the parcel from the hub
                        to its destination location. They are also used in the distribution of raw materials to various
                        end-use industries for manufacturing purposes. Electric vehicles are also being used for various
                        field services wherein any product or some work has to be done at the customer\'s location.
                        Another important application of electric vehicles is long-haul transportation which involves
                        the movement of goods over distances above 400km. This is done usually with the help of electric
                        trucks. Furthermore, electric trucks and cars are also used for refuse collection services
                        engaged in collecting and transporting solid waste for disposal purposes.

                        The Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for the largest revenue share in the regional
                        electric commercial vehicles market. The public transportation sector in China is the major
                        driver of revenue in the Asia-Pacific region. The market is also anticipated to rise owing to
                        the increasing popularity of electrical buses, and trucks in the region. Moreover, technological
                        advancements in the logistics industries will further drive the electric commercial vehicle
                        market growth.One of the fastest-growing occupations in North America is truck driving. The
                        United States is the major hub for electric vehicles which is driving the growth of the
                        North-American regional market. Increasing public awareness and growing consumer demand for
                        commercial vehicles is the driving factor in the region.
